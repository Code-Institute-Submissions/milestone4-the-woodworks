# Milestone 4 - The Woodworks


The milestone 4 project will be a website to showcase content I learned to develop in the last part of the Code Institute's Full stack developer bootcamp. It will be a Django based full stack website. Since I am on an extremely tight schedule I will build a minimal viable product first and expand on that if time permits. 

I chose to build a small e-commerce site for a dear friend of mine who will be starting a training in furniture woodworking and might be selling his creations in the future. The site I will build is a showcase to see how it might work.

As I have been working through the course material I experienced a big overload of information, so I needed to start building my project. In my past experience I found that worked a lot better than just working through the course material. Because of the sheer size of the possibities I will not be designing the whole site beforehand. General mockups and the look and feel can be designed early in the process, but all functionality and features will be chosen and developed as I go along.

## UX

The following features need to be present at a minimum:

- The site needs to be clear and responsive.
- A landing page which will display purchaseable products
- A navbar including a shopping cart and a way to differentiate between a logged on/off user.
- A way to add products to the shopping cart.
- A login system using e-mail confirmation.
- Two additional apps not used in the Boutique Ado mini-project of the course material:
  1. A review page where each product can be reviewed.
  2. Either a contact form, or a page with a poll on what furniture product to develop next.
- A checkout page with fields for an adress to send the product(s) to.
- A working payment system using Stripe and it's testing facilities.
